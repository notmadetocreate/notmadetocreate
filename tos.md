    <h2>Terms of service</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Terms of service page. To be able to make your commission experience the best I can it's important that you read the whole TOS <b>before</b> commissioning me.</p>
</header>

## - Extra important -
<div class="box">
By commissioning me you agree to the terms of service. I have the right to alter my terms of service at any time. As the artist, I wil not break my own terms of service. If you as the client do not read through my terms of service when commissioning me, you will not be excused for being surprised by my TOS. Please be aware that the T.O.S can be changed without warning, therefore I would advise you to read my TOS even if you have commissioned me in the past and read the TOS before.<br>
 
I will <b>not</b> do business with people who are <b>under the age of 16</b>. You will be asked to show your ID to prove that you are 16 years or older. If you are under the age of 16 you will need parental consent to commision art from me. I will ask for prove that this consent has been given. As well as that I need one of your parents to be a contact person for me, so that I will be able to contact them about the process of your commision. In case one of your parents can’t be a contact person, I will accept it if you ask one of your friends (16+) to be the contact person for you.
