    <h2>Terms of service</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Terms of service page. To be able to make your commission experience the best I can it's important that you read the whole TOS <b>before</b> commissioning me.</p>
</header>

## - Extra important -
<div class="box">
By commissioning me you agree to the terms of service. I have the right to alter my terms of service at any time. As the artist, I wil not break my own terms of service. If you as the client do not read through my terms of service when commissioning me, you will not be excused for being surprised by my TOS. Please be aware that the T.O.S can be changed without warning, therefore I would advise you to read my TOS even if you have commissioned me in the past and read the TOS before.<br><br>
 
I will <b>not</b> do business with people who are <b>under the age of 16</b>. You will be asked to show your ID to prove that you are 16 years or older. If you are under the age of 16 you will need parental consent to commision art from me. I will ask for prove that this consent has been given. As well as that I need one of your parents to be a contact person for me, so that I will be able to contact them about the process of your commision. In case one of your parents can’t be a contact person, I will accept it if you ask one of your friends (16+) to be the contact person for you.

<hr />

## - What I need & workprocces -

<b>What I will need:</b>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>clear digital reference sheet</b> with at least two views (front view and back view).</li>
	<li>A brief explanation of their personality, what they like, dislike, ect.</li>
	<li>If you would like anything specific (facial expression, objects, special handwriting for the name, ect) please let me know.</li>
	<li>An shipping address to ship the traditional badge to. Please be as specific as possible when it comes to writing down the address. The way you send it to me will be how I write it down on the envelope. If there is a specific order of how Name, House number, Street, Block, State ect needs to be written down than let me know about this.</li>
</ul>
	
<b>The work process for traditional artworks:</b>
Whenever there is process made I will notify you about that as well uploading the process to my Trello. The work process will be done in the following steps: 
<ol>
	<li>The client will email the artist about the commission. This email will include all important information that will be needed for the artist to start the commission. Such as the type of commission, a clear reference sheet, a preferred pose, ect. (ID card for prove that you are over 16 years old or proof of parental consent)</li>
	<li>The artist will either accept or decline the commission. In case of acceptance the artist will send the client an invoice over Paypal which must be paid within the next ten days. Once this invoice has been send the artist will upload the commission to their Trello so that the client can follow the process of their commissioned art piece.</li>
	<li>Once the sketch is done the artist will notify the client about this as well as updating their Trello. The client may accept or decline the sketch. In case of a decline the artist will either apply small changes to the current sketch or completely start over. In case the sketch is accepted the artist will continue with the line art. <b>Please keep in mind that from this stage on it won’t be possible anymore to ask for refunds and/or changes in the line art/sketch.</b></li>
	<li>Once the lineart is done the artist will notify the client about this as well as updating their Trello. Now it’s time to start with the coloring process. Please keep in mind that with traditional art it won’t always be possible to get the exact same colors as given on the reference sheet. I will of course try my best to achieve the closest possible colour pallet as the one given on the reference sheet. In case the artist notices a colour in the colour pallet which possibly won’t be recreateable the artist will notify the client about this before they start on the commission. The coloring can be divided into three different stages: flat coloring, shading and outline & adding light spots. It is possible to get an update of each stage. The artist will ask which colour you prefer for the outline around your badge</li>
	<li>For the back of the badge I have a big variety of backgrounds to choose from. It is also possible to have your social media info written on the back of the badge so that people can easily know where to contact you and know who to return the badge to in case the badge has been lost. </li>
	<li>Now it’s time to laminate the badge. I laminate my badges with 125 micron plastic sheets. The badges turn out to be less flexible which will prevent them from bending or wrinkling. They are also waterproof. This,of course, only counts for regular conditions. I wouldn’t advise you to go swimming with your badge but they are safe from rainfall at outdoor events. </li>
	<li>Once your badge is laminated it is ready to get shipped out. May I please remind you that it is really important to be as specific as possible when it comes to writing down the address. The way you send it to me will be how I write it down on the envelope. If there is a specific order of how Name, House number, Street, Block, State ect needs to be written down than let me know about this! The artist will send you a picture of the envelope with the address and stamps on it. Once I did a last check or everything is alright the badge will be shipped out. The artist will notify you about this. </li>
	<li>Depending on where you live it can take up two to four weeks before the badge arrives. It would be very much appreciated if the client would notify the artist about this so that the artist knows that their product has arrived safely. The artist is not responsible for any products getting damaged or lost in the post. Of course it is allowed to notify the artist about these issues so that, if possible, they can take measures to prevent this from happening again in the future.</li>
</ol>

## - About the shipping again -
<ul>
	<li>The artist will need a shipping address to ship the traditional badge to. Please be as specific as possible when it comes to writing down the address. The way you send it to the artist will be how the artist will write it down on the envelope. If there is a specific order of how Name, House number, Street, Block, State ect needs to be written down than let us know about this.</li>
	<li>Please be aware that the shipping costs can go up once you order more than one product at the same time. The more products need to be shipped out the heavier the envelope will be, meaning that there will be extra stamps added. </li>
	<li>Depending on where you live it can take up 2 till 4 weeks before the envelope arrives. </li>
	<li>If the post returns to the artist their address due to the shipping address being incorrect, there will be extra shipping costs added on to the commission price. These have to be paid before the artist ships the product out again.</li>
	<li>Please do not add any social media account names as being your first and last name for the shipping address. We have had multiple cases of products being sent back because of invalid names. Examples of incorrect names could be: @Trashraccoon20 @Dyingmutt @Pastelpanda. I won’t require anybody to use their real first and last name. If the client prefers to use a fake first and last name because of privacy than that is totally fine. Just please be aware that the fake first and last names need to be believable. </li>
	<li>The artist is <b>not</b> responsible for any products getting damaged or lost in the post. Of course it is allowed to notify the artist about these issues so that, if possible, they can take measures to prevent this from happening again in the future.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

## - Notes -
<ul>
	<li>By the process of a painted headshot there won’t always be a lineart included into the work process. This depends on the colour scheme and design of the client their character. </li>
	<li>If turns out that the artist has by mistake forgotten to add something ( that was clearly visible on the reference sheet) past the lineart stage it will be added later on. </li>
	<li>There is a change that the artist won’t always be able to work a 100% in line with their queue. Of course I will always try to work according to my queue but there is no 100% guarantee that this will always be the case.  </li>
	<li>I <b>don’t</b> take rush commissions.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

## - What I will & won't draw -
<ul>
	<li>I won't draw anything NSFW themed.</li>
	<li>I won't draw humans.</li>
	<li>I won't draw feral animals.</li>
	<li>I won't draw extreme gore.</li>
	<li>I won't draw anything that could propagate a offensive/hateful message.</li>
	<li>I will draw anthropomorphic characters.</li>
	<li>I will draw mild gore.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

## The work process for digital  artworks:
Will be added in summer 2019!

<hr />

## Last but not least: 
As the artist I ask to be treated with respect. Rude behavior at any time during the commissioning process won’t be accepted and will result in to the client being blocked and dropped from my queue. No refunds will be given at this point.
