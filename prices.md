	<dd>This type of commission is a A4 with a painted headshot of your fursona/character on it. These headshots won’t be laminated.

	<dd>This type of commission is a laminated poster(most often 31 x 31 cm) mainly showing the head of your fursona/character. You can choose a background surrounding the headshot of your character. This illustration as a whole will be added onto the … sized card. This card is double sided. Because of that I can’t change what’s on the back of the card and thus what’s on the back of the poster. Depending on the colour scheme and theme of your poster we will choose the most fitting card together. These posters will be made with alcohol based markers. Each poster will be laminated and send out. <b>Please be aware that the shipping costs of these posters will be higher than the normal shipping costs due to: A3 sized envelopes, A3-sized laminating pouches, a higher total weight and thus a higher total of stamps.</b><br><br>{% include gallery_pricing_Poster_commission.html %}<br><br>Price: €20<br><br></dd>
	<dt>Experimental bust-up commission:</dt>
	<dd>This is a mostly A4 sized commission featuring your character from the head to the underbelly. I am less experienced with making bust-ups. And so these commissions will be experimental ones. These drawings will be made with alcohol based markers. Every bust-up badge will have a background of your choice on the back of it. I have a couple of backgrounds where you can choose from. Every badge will be laminated and shipped out. <br><br>{% include gallery_pricing_Experimental_bust-up_commission.html %}<br><br>Price: €12<br><br></dd>
	<dt>Tailpack commission:</dt>
	<dd>This type of commission consists of three small tail badges. These can be used as keychains. Each tail badge can have it’s own background on the back of it.
