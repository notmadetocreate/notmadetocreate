	<dt>Poster commission: </dt>
	<dd>This type of commission is a laminated poster(most often 31 x 31 cm) mainly showing the head of your fursona/character. You can choose a background surrounding the headshot of your character. This illustration as a whole will be added onto the … sized card. This card is double sided. Because of that I can’t change what’s on the back of the card and thus what’s on the back of the poster. Depending on the colour scheme and theme of your poster we will choose the most fitting card together. These posters will be made with alcohol based markers. Each poster will be laminated and send out. Please be aware that the shipping costs of these posters will be higher than the normal shipping costs due to: A3 sized envelopes, A3-sized laminating pouches, a higher total weight and thus a higher total of stamps. Price: €20</dd>

	<dd>This is a mostly A4 sized commission featuring your character from the head to the underbelly. I am less experienced with making bust-ups. And so these commissions will be experimental ones.

Every badge will be laminated and shipped out. Price: €12</dd>
