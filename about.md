Hey there! Thank you for checking out this about me section. I will list some basic information here as well as some extra facts. 

### Basic information: 
I am an 21 year old guy from the Netherlands who likes to draw and create.

<hr />

### What kind of art do I make?: 
<ul>
    <li>I mainly focus on making traditional anthropomorphic (furry) art. I draw furries because their cuteness and goofynes really goes well with my current traditional art style. Although my traditional art is mostly very toony I do like to practice semi realistic pieces as well. I like to keep my art strictly SFW.</li>
    <li>I want to practice drawing semi realistic humans in 2019. They will probably start to look okay by 2020 or so, so bear with me.</li>
    <li>I want to practise digital art in 2019 as well. This goes for both human and anthro art.</li>
    <li>Sometimes (rarely) I am in the mood to actually go through the process of creating an artwork with a message behind it. The kinds of more serious artworks if you will. Most of the time I work my final piece out in paint after having done a couple of sketches and material experiments.</li>
    <li>I like to write stories and to make character and story world designs. My goal is to start making graphic novels or comic books one day. I probably won’t post much about it on here at first since I don’t have a story that’s so solidified and free of plot holes that I would feel confident enough to share it with the internet.</li>
</ul>

### Are you a furry?:
<div class="box">
Yes. If there was a scale for furries ranging from small to medium to large, I would probably be a medium furry. Let me explain: 
Socially wise I do engage with the fandom. Especially in the art corner of the fandom: I like to make art for people within the fandom, I follow other furry artists who are big inspirations for me and I made a bunch of friends within the fandom.<br>
Fiscally wise I engage a bit less with the fandom. This is mainly because most big furry conventions take place in the VS and I don’t have the possibility yet to fly over there. I am aware that there are big conventions in Europe as well but I would like to have a bit more travel experience before I start that adventure. Sometimes I suit at Dutch fantasy/cosplay conventions/festivals such as Elfia and Castlefest. But those do not count as furry conventions. More often so I cosplay at those conventions/festivals.<br>
Even artwise my interests aren’t only focused on the furryfandom. I follow some comic artists, a lot of artists with ‘human’ art and even some artists who make more classical art.<br>
Overall my main hobby stays writing/creating and the furry & cosplay fandoms just so happen to fit well with that.
