Hey there! Thank you for checking out this about me section. I will list some basic information here as well as some extra facts. 

### Basic information: 
 I am an 21 year old guy from the Netherlands who likes to draw and create. 

### What kind of art do I make?: 
<ul>
    <li>I mainly focus on making traditional anthropomorphic (furry) art. I draw furries because their cuteness and goofynes really goes well with my current traditional art style. Although my traditional art is mostly very toony I do like to practice semi realistic pieces as well. I like to keep my art strictly SFW.</li>
    <li>I want to practice drawing semi realistic humans in 2019. They will probably start to look okay by 2020 or so, so bear with me.</li>
    <li>I want to practise digital art in 2019 as well. This goes for both human and anthro art.</li>
    <li>Sometimes (rarely) I am in the mood to actually go through the process of creating an artwork with a message behind it. The kinds of more serious artworks if you will. Most of the time I work my final piece out in paint after having done a couple of sketches and material experiments.</li>
    <li>I like to write stories and to make character and story world designs. My goal is to start making graphic novels or comic books one day. I probably won’t post much about it on here at first since I don’t have a story that’s so solidified and free of plot holes that I would feel confident enough to share it with the internet.</li>
</ul>

### On which platform am I the most active as if right now?:
I am the most active on Instagram. My instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dax_fox_/">@dax_fox_</a>

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
